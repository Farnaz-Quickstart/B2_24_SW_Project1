# Enable GitHub Pages
Now that your code is on GitHub, enable GitHub Pages to deploy your website:

## Go to the Repository Settings:

- Open the repository on GitHub.
- Click on the Settings tab.
- Scroll to GitHub Pages Section:

- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
- Under Source, select the branch you want to deploy (usually main or master), and then choose /root or /docs folder if that is where your index.html file is.
- Save:

- Click Save to enable GitHub Pages.

## Access Your Website
After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide a URL where your website is hosted. It usually looks like this:

```
https://username.github.io/repository-name/
```

Give it a few minutes to build, and then youâ€™ll be able to access your website at the given URL.
